An early attempt at using Accord Framework .NET machine learning library in Powershell.

I was able to download the library only and load it with `Add-Type`. I then adapted the
example C# K-Means code. The example methods `.Compute()` and `.Nearest()` are marked as
obsolete and point the reader to `.Learn()` and `.Decide()` instead.

`.Compute()` and `.Nearest()` still work. `.Learn()` throws an error, however I believe
it is working and then failing to enumerate/convert its output data to Powershell. The
cluster centroids are defined and subsequent `.Decide()` calls properly fit the datum
to the cluster.

## Files

- scratch.ps1 - My (successful) first attempt at implementing the [example code](http://accord-framework.net/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_KMeans.htm#ID8RBSection) in Powershell.
- scratch2.ps1 - Same as scratch.ps1 except using the recommended non-obsolete method calls. Throws and error on `.Learn()` but does what I need it to.
- ClusterTest2d.ps1 - I wanted a two-dimensional clustering exercise I could plot and ensure it's doing what I think it's doing. It is. Creates out.html as the cluster-colored scatter plot.
- ScatterPlot.html.template - I personally found it easier to use d3.js to do the scatter plot than to try to wrangle the .NET charting libraries, so ClusterTest2d uses this template, replaces a data variable, and then the out.html plot can be viewed in a browser. (I'm doing a lot of F5, tab, F5, view, alt-tab, repeat right now.) This file currently assumes a 100x100 plot area and no more than 7 clusters to color.

## Example Output
